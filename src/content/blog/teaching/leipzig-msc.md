### Table of Content
Knowledge Representation
======
This winter term module consists of a lecture, a seminar, and a practical course

## Practical course
> 2017 - 2020

In this seminar the students should have learned the syntax and semantics of answer set programming.
They should be able to model every-day combinatorial planning problems with ASP and solve them efficiently with the solver [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/).

During my certification process for the Saxon Higher Education Didactics Certificate, this course got redesigned as a blended learning experience which utilised e-learning technologies to enhance in-person learning parts.
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course focused on the e-teaching elements. The in-person sessions have been realised with synchronuous online conferences.
